# Cuber
Arcade game
It is a mobile game that I made in Unity using C# and published it in Google Play. This game is a platformer with 15 levels and endless mode, where you are a cube and slide through different types of obstacles to reach
the end of the level or to slide as far as you can. There is a shop where you can buy different skins on your cube and settings where you can change language and control methods. I also integrated Google AdMob.
